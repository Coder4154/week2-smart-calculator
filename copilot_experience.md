# Copilot Experience Report

## Project: Smart Calculator with Search

### How I Used GitHub Copilot

- I used Copilot to autocomplete the `basic_calculate` function by typing a comment.
- Copilot suggested the correct logic for checking the operator and performing the calculation.
- In the `solve_for_x` method, I typed a comment about brute-force search, and Copilot generated the loop and logic.
- For the `equation_solver_menu`, I typed a comment about getting user input, and Copilot helped structure the parsing logic.
- Copilot also helped format the output for the `visualize_search` method.

### What Worked Well

- Copilot was great at filling in repetitive logic and suggesting correct syntax.

### What I Learned

- Copilot is most helpful when I write clear comments or start a function definition.
- It’s important to review and test Copilot’s suggestions to ensure correctness.

### Overall Experience

Using Copilot made the development process smoother and more efficient. It felt like pair programming with an assistant that understands Python syntax and logic.
